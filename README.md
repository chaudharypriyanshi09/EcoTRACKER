## 📐 **The Carbon Calculation Regression Model**

The app's intelligent carbon calculation is driven by a **multiple linear regression model** that estimates exact baseline CO₂ emissions based on specific vehicle characteristics:

$$\text{CO}_2\text{Emissions} = 183.55 + 70.49 \cdot \text{Mass\_Kg} - 38.67 \cdot \text{vehicle\_type\_M1} - 28.90 \cdot \text{vehicle\_type\_M1G} - 15.25 \cdot \text{vehicle\_type\_MASTER} - 16.26 \[...]

### Variable Parameter Breakdown:

*   **`Mass_Kg`:** Vehicle mass in kilograms. The coefficient (+70.49) indicates that heavier vehicles are directly associated with higher CO₂ emissions.

*   **Vehicle Classification Dummy Variables** (`M1`, `M1G`, `MASTER`, `N1`): These are binary (0 or 1) dummy variables representing:
    - `M1`: Passenger cars
    - `M1G`: Off-road capable vehicles
    - `MASTER`: Master vehicles
    - `N1`: Light commercial vehicles

*   **Fuel Type Dummy Variables:** Binary inputs representing fuel chemistry:
    - **Petrol** (+43.99): Significantly increases emissions
    - **Ethanol E85** (+42.98): High emission impact
    - **Diesel** (+28.45): Moderate-to-high emissions
    - **LPG** (-12.34): Reduces emissions compared to baseline

*   **Intercept (183.55):** The fixed baseline constant representing estimated CO₂ emissions when all other variable metrics are zero (the baseline reference vehicle).

### How Carbon Savings Are Calculated:

When a user completes a trip via walking, cycling, or public transit, the app calculates what the emissions **would have been** with a standard vehicle, then credits the user with those avoided emissi[...]
